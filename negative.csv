 i can't remember anything 
 can't tell if this is true or a dream 
 deep down inside i feel the scream 
 this terrible silence stops me 
 now that the war is through with me 
 i'm waking up i cannot see 
 that there's not much left of me 
 nothing is real but pain now 
  
  
 hold my breath as i wish for death 
 oh please god wake me 
  
   
 back in the womb it's much too real 
 in pumps life that i must feel 
 but can't look forward to reveal 
 look to the time when i'll live 
 fed through the tube that sticks in me 
 just like a wartime novelty 
 tied to machines that make me be

 new blood joins this earth 
 and quickly he's subdued 
 through constant pained disgrace 
 the young boy learns their rules 
 with time the child draws in 
 this whipping boy done wrong 
 deprived of all his thoughts 
 the young man struggles on and on he's known 
 ooh a vow onto his own that never from this day 
 his will they'll take away yeah

 they dedicate their lives 
 to running all of his 
 he tries to please them all 
 this bitter man he is 
 throughout his life the same 
 he's battled constantly 
 this fight he cannot win 
 a tired man they see no longer cares 
 the old man then prepares to die regretfully 
 that old man here is me yeah

 life it seems will fade away 
 drifting further every day 
 getting lost within myself 
 nothing matters no one else 
 i have lost the will to live 
 simply nothing more to give 
 there is nothing more for me 
 need the end to set me free

 missing one inside of me 
 deathly lost this can't be real 
 cannot stand this hell i feel 
 emptiness is filling me 
 to the point of agony 
 growing darkness taking dawn 
 i was me but now he's gone 
  
  
 no one but me can save myself but it's too late 
 now i can't think think why i should even try 
 yesterday seems as though it never existed 
 death greets me warm now i will just say goodbye

 make his fight on the hill in the early day 
 constant chill deep inside 
 shouting gun on they run through the endless grey 
 on they fight for the right yes but who's to say

 i don't wanna talk right now 
 i just wanna watch tv 
 i'll stay in the pool and drown

 i put on survivor just to watch somebody suffer 
 maybe i should get some sleep 
 sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other 
 what's the point of anything

 that's what happens when you fall in love 
 you don't have the time you leave them all behind 
 you tell yourself it's fine you're just in love 
  
   
 don't know where you are right now 
 did you see me on tv 
 i'll try not to starve myself 
 just because you're mad at me 
 and i'll be in denial for at least a little while 
 what about the plans we made 
 the internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial 
 while they're overturning roe v wade

 if i were a boy 
 even just for a day 
 i'd roll out of bed in the mornin' 
 and throw on what i wanted then go 
 drink beer with the guys 
 and chase after girls 
 i'd kick it with who i wanted 
 and i'd never get confronted for it 
 'cause they'd stick up for me 
  
  
 if i were a boy 
 i think i could understand 
 how it feels to love a girl 
 i swear i'd be a better man 
 i'd listen to her 
 'cause i know how it hurts 
 when you lose the one you wanted 
 'cause he's taken you for granted 
 and everything you had got destroyed 
  
   
 if i were a boy 
 i would turn off my phone 
 tell everyone it's broken 
 so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone 
 i'd put myself first 
 and make the rules as i go 
 'cause i know that she'd be faithful 
 waitin' for me to come home

 you don't understand yeah you don't understand oh

 someday you'll wish you were a better man

 but i'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars 
 if you cross me i'm just like my father

 hold rosaries and sing in stained glass symphonies

 from this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

 did my best impression of a damsel in distress

 allured my catch

 feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads

 cut to two woman in a garden one is in the background kneeling the other is carrying a bucket full of vegetables cut to a rear view of the woman carrying the bucket of vegetables the camera follows her as she walks out of the garden and into the yard 
  
 beyoncé vo so we're gonna heal we're gonna start again you've brought the orchestra 
 cut to a rear view of three women two are sitting wearing yellow dresses one is standing wearing a red dress the camera slowly zooms in on the one wearing a red dress 
  
 beyoncé vo synchronized swimmers you are the magician pull me back together again the way you cut me in half 
 cut to a closeup of a man and a woman standing side by side 
  
 beyoncé vo make the woman in doubt disappear 
 cut to beyoncé and six other women sitting on a porch stoop 
  
 beyoncé vo pull the sorrow from between my legs like silk knot after knot after knot 
 cut to a wide view of a sparse forest through which the setting sun can be seen 
  
 beyoncé vo the audience applauds 
  
 cut to black

 sixteen carriages drivin' away 
 while i watch them ride with my dreams away 
 to the summer sunset on a holy night 
 on a long black road all the tears i fight 
 sixteen carriages drivin' away 
 while i watch them ride with my dreams away 
 to the summer sunset on a holy night 
 on a long black road all the tears i fight 
  
   
 at fifteen the innocence was gone astray 
 had to leave my home at an early age 
 i saw mama prayin' i saw daddy grind 
 all my tender problems had to leave behind 
  
 pre 
 it's been umpteen summers and i'm not in my bed 
 on the back of the bus in a bunk with the band 
 goin' so hard gotta choose myself 
 undеrpaid and overwhelmed 
 i might cook clеan but still won't fold 
 still workin' all my life you know 
 only god knows only god knows

 to the summer sunset on a holy night 
 on a long back road all the tears i fight

 i got love to create on this holy night 
 they won't dim my light all these years i fight

 it's been thirtyeight summers and i'm not in my bed 
 on the back of the bus in a bunk with the band 
 goin' so hard now i miss my kids 
 overworked and overwhelmed 
 i might cook clean but still won't fold 
 still workin' all my life you know 
 only god knows only god knows

 i met this girl late last year 
 she said don't you worry if i disappear 
 i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake 
 i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait 
 but then i jumped right in a week later returned 
 i reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn 
 but i gave her my time for two or three nights 
 then i put it on pause until the moment was right 
 i went away for months until our paths crossed again 
 she told me i was never looking for a friend 
 maybe you could swing by my room around  
 baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin 
 we'll be in between the sheets till the late am 
 baby if you wanted me then you should have just said she's singin' 
  
  
 don't  with my love 
 that heart is so cold 
 all over my home 
 i don't wanna know that babe 
 don't  with my love 
 i told her she knows 
 take aim and reload 
 i don't wanna know that babe 
 see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as you might also like  
 and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her 
 we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza 
 before a text message was the only way to reach her 
 now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way i treat her 
 singing out aretha all over the track like a feature 
 and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either 
 but me and her we make money the same way 
 four cities two planes the same day 
 and those shows have never been what it's about 
 but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out 
 i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch 
 but we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now 
 wish i'd have written it down the way that things played out 
 when she was kissin' him how i was confused about 
 now she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing 
  
  
 don't  with my love 
 that heart is so cold 
 all over my home 
 i don't wanna know that babe 
 don't  with my love 
 i told her she knows

 i don't wanna know that babe

 it's not like we were both on tour 
 we were stayin' on the same  hotel floor 
 and i wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment 
 but it was never just fun and i thought you were different 
 this is not the way you realised what you wanted 
 it's a bit too much too late if i'm honest 
 and all this time god knows i'm singin'

 keep careful watch of my brothers' souls 
 and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
 keep watching over durin's sons

 watch the flames climb high into the night

 watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high 
 and if we should die tonight we should all die together 
 raise a glass of wine for the last time 
 callin' out father oh prepare as we will 
 watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside 
 desolation comes upon the sky

 and i see fire burning the trees 
 and i see fire hollowin' souls 
 i see fire blood in the breeze 
 and i hope that you remember me 
  
   
 oh should my people fall then surely i'll do the same 
 confined in mountain halls we got too close to the flame

 i was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree 
 i bet my mother's proud of me 
 from each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee 
 and all i know 
 is i got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat 
 he kicked me out and then i walked in the rain 
 i tell myself in every way i won't be doing this again

 and in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams 
 my heart is breaking at the seams and i'm coming apart now 
 now things are looking up i'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree 
 and i'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon 
 looking around for the things that i left on the ground

 watched the crimson sunrise 
 imagined what it might find

 i must explore the boundaries 
 transcend the depth of winter's snow

 hoping to find in me

 we cannot just let him leave here

 and steadily he would decline

 kept to himself most of the time 
 he would daydream in and out of his own world 
 but in every other way he was fine

 disturbed from time to time 
 lost within himself 
 in his solitary shell 
  
 a temporary catatonic 
 madman on occasion 
 when will he break out 
 of his solitary shell 
  
   
 he struggled to get through his day 
 he was helplessly behind 
 he poured himself onto the page 
 writing for hours at a time

 fearful and sad most of the time 
 he was drifting in and out of sanity 
 but in every other way he was fine

 disturbed from time to time 
 lost within himself 
 in his solitary shell

 she dresses in black everyday 
 she keeps her hair simple and plain 
 she never wears makeup 
 but no one would care if she did anyway 
  
 she doesn't recall yesterday 
 faces seem twisted and strange 
 but she always wakes up 
 only to find she'd been miles away 
  
 refrain 
 absence of awareness losing time 
 a lapse of perception losing time 
  
   
 wanting to escape 
 she had created a way to survive 
 she learned to detach from herself 
 a behavior that kept her alive 
  
  
 hope in the face of our human distress 
 helps us to understand 
 the turbulence deep inside 
 that takes hold of our lives 
  
 shame and disgrace over mental unrest 
 keeps us from saving those we love 
 the grace within our hearts 
 and the sorrow in our souls 
  
  
 deception of fame 
 vengeance of war 
 lives torn apart 
  
 losing oneself 
 spiraling down 
 feeling the walls closing in 
  
 a journey to find 
 the answers inside 
 our elusive mind

 hello mirror so glad to see you my friend 
 it's been a while 
  
   
 staring at the empty page before me 
 all the years of wreckage running through my head 
 patterns of my life i thought adorned me 
 revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

 all the damage now so clear and evident 
 thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me 
 a bitter fear at the thought of my amends 
  
 hoping that the step will help restore me 
 to face my past and ask for forgiveness 
 cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street 
 could this be the beginning of the end

 spoken  mike portnoy 
 if we are painstaking about this phase of our development 
 we will be amazed before we are halfway through 
 we are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness 
 we will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it 
  
 we will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace 
 no matter how far down the scale we have gone 
 we will see how our experience can benefit others 
 that feeling of uselessness and selfpity will disappear 
  
 we will lose interest in selfish things 
 and gain interest in our fellows 
 selfseeking will slip away 
 our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change 
  
 fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us 
 we will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us 
 we will suddenly realize that god is doing for us 
 what we could not do for ourselves 
  
 are these extravagant promises we think not 
 they have been fulfilled amongst others 
 sometimes quickly sometimes slowly 
 we will always be true to our principles

Sting,"contributorsmad about you lyricsa stone's throw from jerusalem 
 i walked a lonely mile in the moonlight 
 and though a million stars were shining 
 my heart was lost on a distant planet 
 that whirls around the april moon 
 whirling in an arc of sadness 
 i'm lost without you 
 i'm lost without you 
 though all my kingdoms turn to sand 
 and fall into the sea 
 i'm mad about you 
 i'm mad about you 
  
 and from the dark secluded valleys 
 i heard the ancient songs of sadness 
 but every step i thought of you 
 every footstep only you 
 and every star a grain of sand 
 the leavings of a dried up ocean 
 tell me how much longer 
 how much longer 
  
 they say a city in the desert lies 
 the vanity of an ancient king 
 but the city lies in broken pieces 
 where the wind howls and the vultures sing 
 these are the works of man 
 this is the sum of our ambition 
 it would make a prison of my life 
 if you became another's wife 
 with every prison blown to dust 
 my enemies walk free 
 i'm mad about you 
 i'm mad about you 
 see sting liveget tickets as low as you might also likeand i have never in my life 
 felt more alone than i do now 
 although i claim dominions over all i see 
 it means nothing to me 
 there are no victories 
 in all our histories without love 
  
 a stone's throw from jerusalem 
 i walked a lonely mile in the moonlight 
 and through a million stars were shining 
 my heart was lost on a distant planet 
 that whirls around the april moon

 seven days was all she wrote 
 a kind of ultimatum note 
 she gave to me she gave to me 
 when i thought the field had cleared 
 it seems another suit appeared 
 to challenge me woe is me 
 though i hate to make a choice 
 my options are decreasing mostly rapidly

 i really have to make her mine 
 it's plain to see 
 it's him or me

 he'll murder me 
 in time for his tea 
 does it bother me at all

 it makes me think 
 perhaps i need a drink

 we won't be playing scrabble for

 where is the keeper in his carrion coat

 a vintage that blessed every ship in the line 
 it's wrung from the blood of the sailor's who died 
 young white bodies adrift in the tide'

 but i was going down with it 
 my whiteknuckle dying grip 
 holding tight to your quiet resentment 
 and my friends said it isn't right to be scared 
 every day of a love affair 
 every breath feels like rarest air 
 when you're not sure if he wants to be there 
  
 so how much sad did you think i had 
 did you think i had in me 
 how much tragedy 
 just how low did you 
 think i'd go 'fore i'd selfimplode 
 'fore i'd have to go be free 
  
   
 you swore that you loved me but where were the clues 
 i died on the altar waitin' for the proof 
 you sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days 
 and i'm just getting color back into my face 
 i'm just mad as hell 'cause i loved this place for 
  
 so so long long london london 
 had had a a good good run run 
 a moment moment of warm sun sun 
 but i'm i'm not not the the one one

 i have this thing where i get older but just never wiser 
 midnights become my afternoons 
 when my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people 
 i've ghosted stand there in the room

 i should not be left to my own devices 
 they come with prices and vices 
 i end up in crisis 
 tale as old as time 
 i wake up screaming from dreaming 
 one day i'll watch as you're leaving 
 'cause you got tired of my scheming 
 for the last time

 at teatime everybody agrees 
 i'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror 
 it must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero 
  
   
 sometimes i feel like everybody is a sexy baby 
 and i'm a monster on the hill 
 too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city 
 pierced through the heart but never killed

 did you hear my covert narcissism i disguise as altruism 
 like some kind of congressman 
 a tale as old as time 
 i wake up screaming from dreaming 
 one day i'll watch as you're leaving
