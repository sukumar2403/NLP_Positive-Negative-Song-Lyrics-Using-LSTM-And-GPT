""Fuckin' coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Oh shit, oh fuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!""
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye

Make his fight, on the hill, in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill — Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

Time marches on

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on

Feeding on the wrath of man
Shot down, traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone, dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down, volcanic
But what is gone is gone and done
Look back, psychotic
No chance before this life began

[Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Dominating birthright

[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Leaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone

Shoot back, erratic
Mad seasons take their toll

Completely lost control
Shoot back, fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back, narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past

Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Pullin' your puzzles apart

By a carnival of idiots on show

When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God

Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
A flock of birds, hovering above
Just a flock of birds, that's how you think of love
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

[Verse 2]
A flock of birds, hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned, and rise, following 'em up
Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next, you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on, on

[Outro]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

Wait 'til the world is mine

Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

Blood on a marble wall

Tell me which one is worse

You could be my wife
Could get into a fight
I'll say, ""You're right""
And you'll kiss me goodnight

Was easy getting over and I landed on my feet
I came in through the kitchen lookin' for something to eat
I left a calling card so they would know that it was me

I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag

Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill

Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around

Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease

Part II: ***Flawless
[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie & Beyoncé]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad

Yuh, tonight, I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' stripper to a super CEO
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup, on the 35th of Nevuary
Yup, you love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl
We just messed up a brand new couch, girl
If you ain't on site, then you on Skype

On sight, catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Intro: Beyoncé & Alaina Reed-Hall]
The winner is: Beyoncé Knowles, female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
[Verse: Beyoncé]
And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin' solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder, ""How come?""
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm lookin' off the edge, I preach my gut, it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbin' up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is borin'
All the shit I do is borin', all these record labels borin'
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive, how come?

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight

[Verse 1]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to leave my home at an early age
I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind
All my tender problems, had to leave behind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been umpteen summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself
Undеrpaid and overwhelmed
I might cook, clеan, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages drivin' away

To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight

[Verse 2]
Sixteen dollars, workin' all day
Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make
I got love to create on this holy night
They won't dim my light, all these years I fight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been thirty-eight summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, now I miss my kids
Overworked and overwhelmed
I might cook, clean, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all these tears I fight

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh

[Bridge]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to take care of home at an early age
I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
For legacy, if it's the last thing I do
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
In your memory, on the highway to truth
Still see our faces when you close your eyes

Everything is cool between us, Bey, I told you that (Oh)

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that, with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now, I moved on
Because I realized I've got

I got these girls tryna lock me down
And I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I don't know where to go
After you loved me this way
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay? Oh

[Chorus]
You tell me I'm too young, but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the '90s
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Go and treat me like)

I was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home
You kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask, ""Who is that, babe?""
And the way you said, ""Nobody""
I knew the rumors
They were more than just rumors

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been givin' it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now, you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that
You were my girl (Ooh, ooh)

I'll try to go find some other high

Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week

She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""

And those shows have never been what it's about

But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid

As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)

If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes

You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed

So why would I quit?

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this **** should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans

I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now

The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone

And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No

Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody

On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me

'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song
It goes on and on

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't, then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinkin' fast, and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too

I gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride

I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee

Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams

Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we've got nothin' to say and nothin' to know

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

[Pre-Chorus]
My father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missin' you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never gettin' dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down, come around
Break-up the love like LEGO now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying, every day, that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

Oh, you and I

Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (Woah)
And I'm thinkin' I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep lookin' around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

Ed-sheeran,"64 ContributorsTake It Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know
You found me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now

[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin', ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still, they're claiming that I handled it wrong
But then, I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart, cover the planet
I'll take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
I'll take it back now
[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from a man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes, I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made
And, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
Mmm, come on and take it back, love

I met you when I was a teen, but then, you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say, ""You are beautiful without your makeup
And you don't even need to worry 'bout your weight
'cause we can all be loved the way that God made us""
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?

With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold

Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand, but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever, so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again

If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

[Refrain]
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home

You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you35Embed"

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again

Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the truth's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

At ease
Eating well

Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends

Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

[Verse]
But it was just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle, and so we crumble
A ten ton head made of wet sand, oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me, the grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass, it was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is, in split infinity

It touches  like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See, the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
'Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells

Mm-hmm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else

The people have this power

The river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup

Take back what is ours

[Verse 1: James LaBrie]
I never wanted to become someone like him, so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd never be someone like him!

[Verse 2: James LaBrie]
So many years have passed since I proclaimed
My independence, my mission
My aim and my vision, so secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm missing out this time

[Verse 3: James LaBrie]
As far as I could tell, there's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself, could this be everything?
Then all I swore, that I would never be was now
So suddenly, the only thing, I wanted to become
To be someone just like him

The smile of dawn arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear, to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain, she'll never outgrow
Death is the first dance, eternal!
There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined
To this mind

[Verse 2]
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire
As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man, I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep, yet I'm so afraid!

[Verse 3]
Somewhere like a scene from a memory (Scene from a memory)
There's a picture worth a thousand words (A thousand words)
Eluding stares the faces before me (Faces before me)
It hides away and will never be heard of again (Never be heard of again)

Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive

This could be the last time
You see me alive!
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived
[Verse 2]
""Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candlelight""

Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls

Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

[Pre-Chorus]
Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the English heir
The end is near
""Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age""

[Chorus]
I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive!
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

[Outro]
""Now wait a minute, man!
That's not how it is!
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems

Please try to forgive!

The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother, tell them about me...

The Count of Tuscany!""

[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She can't stop pacing, she never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing, set on overdrive

It takes a village, this she knows is true
They're expecting her and she's got work to do

[Chorus 1]
He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says ""I've never seen her get this bad""

Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
And when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by

She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her

And she tried everyday
With endless drive to make the grade
Then one day, she woke up to find
The perfect girl had lost her mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away

[Chorus 2]
She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad

Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky

But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression

Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace

Boundless power, midnight hour

Napalm showers showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around
Through heat exhaustion and mind distortion
A military victory mounted on innocent ground

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day

[IV. The Test That Stumped Them All]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Standing in the darkness, waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline burning in the night
Random blinding flashes aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll, igniting sonic rage

[Chorus 1]
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me the answers to the test that stumped them all

[Bridge 1]
""The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution""

""He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself!""

[Verse 2]
Curled up in the darkness, searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit streaming through the night
Random urine testing; pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy, providing not a clue

[Chorus 2]
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

[Bridge 2]
""We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste""
""Why don't we try shock treatment?
It really might do some help
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself!""

[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head

[Chorus 1]
Are you lonely without mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl, afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[Verse 2]
It's been five years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay

I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment

[VI. Solitary Shell]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy
He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
And steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell

[Pre-Chorus]
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
But in every other way he was fine

[Chorus 1]
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell?

[Verse 2]
He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time

[Pre-Chorus]
As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine

[Chorus 2]
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell?

[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm alive again, the darkness far behind me
I'm invincible, despair will never find me
I feel strong, I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy, euphoria fixation

[Chorus 1]
Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry
Who would ever know I felt so sad?

Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you be standing by?

[VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway

She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away

[Refrain]
Absence of awareness, losing time
A lapse of perception, losing time

[Verse 2]
Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive

[Bridge]
Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand
The turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives

Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls

[Outro]
Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart!

Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in

A journey to find
The answers inside
Our elusive mind

Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes

[Verse 1]
Let me help you, how much longer until you realize?
You're getting worse
It's killing you inside
I can't break through
Feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

[Chorus]
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

[Verse 2]
You feel I'm asking too much of you but can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy, empty and hollow
You lost your faith, there's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery, can't figure it out

Numb, sedated, intoxicated

Warped inside its never ending tide

[Instrumental Intro]

[Intro]
Hello Mirror, so glad to see you, my friend
It's been a while

[Verse 1]
Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

[Pre-Chorus]
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

[Chorus]
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

""Until that moment, I'd never felt like I'd failed at anything
And I felt like I failed her
And I failed myself, and I failed my children
It's still really hard to deal with.""
[Steve Vai]
""I want to thank you for helping me to see my own selfishness
And to tell you how regretful I am it has hurt you.""

[Chris Jericho]
""I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, Grandpa
When you were on your deathbed
I'm sorry I didn't come to your funeral
I don't know if I was selfish or I just was too scared to face it
It's one of the biggest regrets of my life.""

[David Ellefson]
""I'm here to confess with you that what I did was wrong
And I'm asking for your forgiveness...""

[Steve Hogarth]
""The only unforgivable thing hauls itself out of bed
Looks over my shoulder at the bloody English weather.""

[Joe Satriani]
""I really regret not being able to see my friend Andy.""

[Mikael Åkerfeldt]
""One of my best friends, who's the godfather of my daughter
He asked me to sing or play something at his wedding
And I turned it down because I was busy and
I guess, too much of a chickenshit to do it
And I feel sorry for that, because it was a very, very close friend of mine.""
[Steven Wilson]
""So, I wanted to apologize to anyone
That I've upset or offended by my words
It's just an opinion, but unfortunately
I tend to express it as a fact
And that's kind of arrogant. isn't it?""

[Jon Anderson]
""I think it's the betrayal
It still haunts me.""

[Neal Morse]
""I'm sorry for what I did back then
I was a different person
I really was and I'm so sorry
I wish it wouldn't have happened, but it did
And I'm sorry
Will you forgive me?""

[Daniel Gildenlöw]
""I guess I'm simply sorry for being me and not you
I so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way.""

[Spoken Outro: Mike Portnoy]
""If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it

We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone
We will see how our experience can benefit others
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear

We will lose interest in selfish things
And gain interest in our fellows
Self-seeking will slip away
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change

Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us
What we could not do for ourselves

Are these extravagant promises, we think not
They have been fulfilled amongst others:
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly
We will always be true to our principles.""

There was no time for pain
No energy for anger
The sightlessness of hatred slips away
Walking through winter streets alone
He stops and takes a breath with confidence and self-control

I look at the world and see no understanding
I'm waiting to find some sense of strength
I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart
To show me understanding

Like some people never will
So find me kindness
Find me beauty
Find me truth
When temptation brings me to my knees
And I lay here drained of strength

At times a step away
From a common fear that's all spread out

And now I reach for life

Another chance to lift my life
Free the sensation in my heart
To ride the wings of dreams
Into changing horizons
It brings inner peace within my mind
As I'm lifted from where I've spilt my life
I hear an innocent voice
I hear kindness, beauty and truth

""Close your eyes and begin to relax
Take a deep breath and let it out slowly
Concentrate on your breathing
With each breath you become more relaxed

Imagine a brilliant white light above you
Focus in on this light as it flows through your body
Allow yourself to drift off as you fall
Deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind

Now, as I count back from ten to one
You will feel more peaceful and calm
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you
Five, four, three, two
If at any time you need to come back
All you need to do is open your eyes
One.""

[Verse: Nicholas]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again
Nothing seems real, I'm starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream
And as I draw near, the scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen

[Verse 1]
We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter
You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see
You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
''Gimme time to re-charge my batteries
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee''
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality!
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief
Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all-day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me
Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hello, mirror - so glad to see you, my friend
It's been a while
Searching, fearless, where do I begin to heal this wound
Of self-denial?

Face yourself, man!
Brace yourself and
Trace your hell back!

You've been blinded, living like a one-way cold existence
All the while
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes
You long lost child!

[Chorus 1]
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking
And shaking
And left in the cold

I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul
This dying soul
This dying soul!

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you
Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain into blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty-one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

[Verse 2]
Possessive obsessions
Selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments
Passing all the blame
[Fast Rap Verse 2]
Living out a life of decadence
Acting without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while they can't stand the thought of you!

[Verse 3]
A living reflection
Seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction
Having run astray

[Chorus 2]
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking
And shaking
And left in the cold

I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul
This dying soul
This dying soul!

Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

Come to me, my friend (Listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (Help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)

You'll find your peace of mind (Give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (Break out of this isolation)
Let humility (Openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (A healing tranquility)

[Refrain]
Help me, save me, heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

[Verse 5]
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help I know you can
Be at one with God and man!

Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?
They say "" Life is too short""
""The here and the now""
And "" You`re only given one shot""
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

[Chorus]
If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

[Verse 2]
I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend
I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

The perfect irony
A flawless new beginning
Eclipsed by tragedy

Started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride
And we made our way back home
Life was so simple then
We were so innocent

Sudden stillness
Wrapped in silence
No more screaming

And said, ""Take this for the pain."" (Take this for the pain)

Flesh of the undead, stopping at nothing to kill

Committed the greatest of all
Sold half of my soul and now it's too late for you

I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Your time has come!

Lord, you are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk through the abyss
Into the shadow of death

Fear, there is no evil to fear now
For I know you are with me
My cup overflows
With my enemy's blood

I decay in the house of the Lord
Forever amen
Death will follow me
All the days of my life

I judge as my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
Your time has come!

Servants of the fallen fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling on this wicked day
Through a veil of madness, with a vicious blade
One man rises up, standing in their way

It's time for your reckoning!

I do not fight for you, Dark Master!

As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind

You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love

And their great-grandchildren will tell

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand

Don't make it in the groove

Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers

There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love

And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

And far more than a lucky chance

The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

[Chorus]
But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world (Cold, too cold)
[Chorus]
You took me riding in a rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped my Black ass
Down to this cold, cold world
...me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down into this cold, cold world
(I would not do that to a dog, baby)

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back

Stevie-wonder,"17 ContributorsThat Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

[Chorus]
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

[Bridge]
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do

But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

[Verse 2]
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

[Verse 3]
Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the street
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?

I've always come to the conclusion that ""but"" is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on one's head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside, I think you should know

[Chorus]
And baby, that's you, you, you
Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

[Verse 2]
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, it's you, you, you
Made life's history (Oh, baby)
You've brought some joy inside my tears

When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

[Verse 2]
When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Packing my bags, going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

[Verse 1]
There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages, all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought or sold
Tell me, why are you people so cold?

[Chorus]
I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly

That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star

I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife

A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face

[Chorus]
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head

[Verse 2]
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief

A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves

Sting,"20 ContributorsSeven Days Lyrics[Intro]
[Verse 1]
""Seven Days"" was all she wrote
A kind of ultimatum note
She gave to me, she gave to me
When I thought the field had cleared
It seems another suit appeared
To challenge me, woe is me
Though I hate to make a choice
My options are decreasing mostly rapidly
Well we'll see

I don't think she'd bluff this time
I really have to make her mine
It's plain to see
It's him or me

[Chorus]
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late

The fact he's over six feet ten
Might instill fear in other men
But not in me
The mighty flea
Ask if I am mouse or man
The mirror squeaked, away I ran
He'll murder me
In time for his tea
Does it bother me at all
My rival is Neanderthal
It makes me think
Perhaps I need a drink
IQ is no problem here
We won't be playing Scrabble for
Her hand I fear
I need that beer

Sting,"12 ContributorsBrand New Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

[Chorus 1]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss

Sting,"23 ContributorsAll This Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
[Verse 2]
Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

[Verse 3]
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?

Sting,"12 ContributorsFortress Around Your Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire
[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

For I know what I do must be wrong

That I became what I am
I was trapped in this life
Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking
By the light of the moon

Hides the eye of a beast

And destroy the thing I love

It's all there in the gospels, the Magdalene girl
Comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl
When she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still
""Tell me where are you going Lord, and why in such haste?""
Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I can not be missing, the lads will expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey

Sting,"8 ContributorsIf It’s Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jumped out of bed this morning
With a smile upon my face
It's still there while I shave my chin
But the reason's hard for me to trace
I cook myself some breakfast
Have some coffee while I muse
Where could this smile have come from?
It's a muscle that I rarely use

[Pre-Chorus]
Call the doctor with my symptoms
Should I spend all day in bed?
Can you explain what's ailing me?
And that is what my doctor said

[Chorus]
If it's love, it has no season
If it's love, there is no cure
If it's love, it won't see reason
And of this you can be sure
If it's lovе, you must surrender (You must surrendеr)
If it's love that's turned you 'round (That's turned you 'round)
If it's love, the odds are slender (The odds are)
If it's love, you're sunk without a trace
One case can bring you down

And this is what my doctor wrote

If it's love, it won't see reason
And of this you can be sure
If it's love, you must surrender (You must surrender)

Over the reefs of moonshine
Under the skies of fall
North-northwest, the Stones of Faroe
Under the Arctic fire
Over the seas of silence
Hauling on frozen ropes
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?

All colours bleed to red
Asleep on the ocean's bed
Drifting on empty seas
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?

Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?

Dark angels follow me
Over a godless sea
Mountains of endless falling
For all my days remaining

Round, like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever-spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning, running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 2]
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of it's own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half-forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on it's face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Bridge]
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why does summer go so quickly? Was it something that you said?
Lovers walk along the shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and a fragment of this song
Half remembered names and faces but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair?

Sting,"14 ContributorsMy Funny Friend and Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the quiet time of evening
When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
And we wondered just what happened
To the life we knew before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me and you reminded me
That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
And when a simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter
But you stayed in my corner
The only world I know was upside down
And now the world and me, I know you carry me

[Chorus]
You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But we made it through in the dark night
Would those lucky guys turn out to be
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me

[Verse 2]
I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different, you showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure
But you stayed and you called my name
When others would have walked out on a lousy game
And you could've made it through
But your funny friend and me

Of those two funny friends

Mystical attraction

Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 2]
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 3]
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""

I watch the western sky, the sun is sinking
The geese are flying south, it sets me thinking
I did not miss you much, I did not suffer
What did not kill me just made me tougher

I feel the winter come, his icy sinews
Now in the firelight, the case continues
Another night in court, the same old trial
The same old questions asked, the same denial

The shadows close me round, like jury members
I look for answers in the fire's embers
Why was I missing then, that whole December?
I give my usual line: I don't remember

Another winter comes, his icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine, these memories never sleep
And all these differences, a cloak I borrow
We kept our distances, why should it follow
That I must have loved you?

What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
I never could find a place to hide
What moves the Earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love, afraid to fail

Sting,"8 ContributorsThe Lazarus Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
He looked beneath his shirt today
There was a wound in his flesh so deep and wide
From the wound a lovely flower grew
From somewhere deep inside
He turned around to face his mother
To show her the wound in his breast that burned like a brand
But the sword that cut him open
Was the sword in his mother's hand

[Chorus]
Every day another miracle
Only death will tear us apart
To sacrifice a life for yours
I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart
The blood of the Lazarus heart

[Verse 2]
Though the sword was his protection
The wound itself would give him power
The power to remake himself at the time of his darkest hour
She said the wound would give him courage and pain
The kind of pain that you can't hide
From the wound a lovely flower grew
From somewhere deep inside

Birds on the roof of my mother's house
I've no stones that chase them away
Birds on the roof of my mother's house
Will sit on my own roof some day
They fly at the window, they fly at the door
Where does she get the strength to fight them anymore
Counts all her children as a shield against the pain
Lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain

Only death will tear us apart

Sting,"1 ContributorAll Would Envy LyricsOld enough to be her dad
But the young men were just mad they nursed their grievances
And she was flattered by his charm
It wouldn't do her any harm they all had their chances

He sent her flowers and limousines
She was treated like a queen
Anything she ever wanted
It was no problem for a man like him
And everyone expected soon
That she could ask him for the moon
If she would wear his ring

Knowing glances from his friends
In the homes at the weekends of high society
But he didn't give a damn
He never felt more like a man

And all the time the clock was ticking
And all would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes, all would envy

In a house upon a hill
She was there with time to kill
She lived a life she'd only dreamed
The life was never what it seemed
To all her friends that she'd ignored
She denied she was bored
She had no time for dancing, no time for dancing

That was ticking in the hall
Always reminded her
That life was going on as well
But she was happy and she would swear she wouldn't change a thing

And all would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes, all would envy

Now it's 5 o'clock AM
She must have spent the night again with that old friend of hers
She loves to dance
She's missing more and more these days
But he's still stuck in his old ways
Perhaps she needs a little more romance
But the clock upon the wall is still ticking in the hall
She must be home soon, soon
Where a younger man would weep
He takes a pill and goes to sleep

Now who would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Who would envy?
Who would envy?Embed"
Sting,"9 ContributorsThe Soul Cages Lyrics[Verse 1]
The boy child is locked in the fisherman's yard
There's a bloodless moon where the ocean died
A shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets
And the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie
Where is the fisherman, where is the goat?
Where is the keeper in his carrion coat?
Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies
Where is the child with his father's eyes?

[Verse 2]
He's the king of the ninth world
The twisted son of the fog bells toll
In each and every lobster cage
A tortured human soul
These are the souls of broken factories
The subject slaves of the broken crown
The dead accounting of old guilty promises
These are the souls of the broken town

[Chorus]
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages

'I have a wager' the brave child spoke
The fisherman laughed, though disturbed at the joke
'You will drink what I drink but you must equal me
And if the drink leaves me standing, a soul shall go free'
'I have here a cask of most magical wine
A vintage that blessed every ship in the line
It's wrung from the blood of the sailor's who died
Young white bodies adrift in the tide'
'And what's in it for me, my pretty young thing?
Why should I whistle, when the caged bird sings?
If you lose a wager with the king of the sea
You'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me

[Chorus]
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages

[Verse 4]
A body lies open in the fisherman's yard
Like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips
One less soul in the soul cages
One last curse on the fisherman's lips

Sting,"6 ContributorsStolen Car (Take Me Dancing) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Late at night in summer heat expensive car, empty street
There's a wire in my jacket, this is my trade
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid
I can hot-wire an ignition like some kind of star
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car
So I whisper to the engine, flick on the lights
And we drive into the night

[Verse 2]
Oh, the smell of the leather always excited my imagination
And I picture myself in this different situation
I'm a company director, two kids and a wife
I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life
There's some kind of complication, he tells her he's alone
Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near
Start ringing in my ear

[Chorus]
Please take me dancing tonight, I've been all on my own
You promised one day we could, it's what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love, always hid from the light
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight

[Verse 3]
I imagine his wife, she don't look, nothing like a fool
She picks the kids up from some private school
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone
But there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne
And the kid's just won't be quiet, and she runs a traffic light
And she drives into the night

Sting,"4 ContributorsThe Book of My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me watch by the fire and remember my days
And it may be a trick of the firelight
But the flickering pages that trouble my sight
Is a book I'm afraid to write

It's the book of my days, it's the book of my life
And it's cut like a fruit on the blade of a knife
And it's all there to see as the section reveals
There's some sorrow in every life

If it reads like a puzzle, a wandering maze
Then I won't understand 'til the end of my days
I'm still forced to remember
Remember the words of my life

[Verse 2]
There are promises broken and promises kept
Angry words that were spoken, when I should have wept
There's a chapter of secrets, and words to confess
If I lose everything that I possess
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies

Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read

Sting,"5 ContributorsI Love Her But She Loves Someone Else Lyrics[Verse 1]
When a man of my age shaves his face in the morning
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father long dead all these years?
Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears?
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him?
So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline
To face up to the truth of his soul
It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge
Something strange, unexpected, out of control
There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection
And face what he sees without fear
It takes a man to accept his mortality
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear
It was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement
I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook
Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself
And fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else

[Chorus]
Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts
You still love her but she loves someone else

You feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind?

Use the ice around your heart before it melts
But you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself

And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith

And who's gonna hold you like me?

You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head

Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be

So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too

'Cause something counterfeit's dead?

It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies

In your Jehovah's Witness suit

From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give

Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off

I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive

This cage was once just fine

Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox

Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling

See you make your way through the crowd

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time

Ask her if she wants to stay a while

Would've left this world behind

Would've waited a thousand nights

But now I smile when I remember

I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed

So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You should know better, you never listened to a word I said

On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out

And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both

It may not last, but I don't know
Just don't know

If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting, and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2]
A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun""
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah

I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

My life is a movie
And everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part
And past all the nonsense

When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is27Embed"

There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
Yeah
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
Of course
And you found yourself under it recently, some headlines
To set the record straight, none of it is true
Do you know this woman?
Never met the woman, so
No? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh
Exactly
Life in the fast lane, as they say

[Verse 1]
She said she met me on the tour
She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl, she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', ooh, she was wrong

And she was dragging my name through the dirt (Oh)
She was dying for my affection

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips

Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption

Night after night, you fall asleep on me (Sleep on me)
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was (Oh, no, no no, no)

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (Oh)
I need you, don't let me go (No), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight

[Bridge]
Somewhere in the sky (Yeah), the way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me, I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na)
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah), as you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong (Oh)

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (I can't live without you)
I need you, don't let me go (Hey), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de– (I don't), I don't de– (I don't)
I don't deserve you tonight (You)
[Outro]
(I don't deserve you)
No, I don't, no
(I don't deserve you)
Girl, I need you, I can't breathe without you5Embed"
