# Positive & Negative Song Lyrics Using LSTM and GPT  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes song lyrics to classify them into positive and negative sentiments using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. It involves generating new song lyrics and evaluating their sentiment through advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques.  

## Features  
- Sentiment analysis of song lyrics (positive or negative) using LSTM.  
- Generation of song lyrics tailored to specific moods with GPT.  
- Cosine similarity analysis to measure closeness between real and generated lyrics.  
- Visualization of dataset statistics, generated content, and similarity results.  
- Use of LyricsGeniusAPI for real-time lyric scraping.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of real song lyrics categorized as either positive or negative. Additional generated datasets are created using GPT models, allowing for a comparative analysis of the results.  

## Tools & Libraries  
- **Frameworks**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **APIs**: LyricsGeniusAPI  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Sentiment Analysis: VADER  
  - Modeling: LSTM, GPT  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Key Visualizations  
1. **Song Lyrics Dataset Distribution**: Shows the count of positive and negative lyrics in the dataset.  
2. **Generated Song Dataset Comparison**: Highlights differences in sentiment distribution between real and generated songs.  
3. **Cosine Similarity**:  
   - Real vs Generated (LSTM)  
   - Real vs Generated (GPT)  

## Results  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Successful classification of lyrics into positive and negative moods.  
- **Lyric Generation**: GPT effectively generated lyrics reflecting the desired sentiment.  
- **Cosine Similarity Analysis**: Evaluated the similarity between real lyrics and those generated by LSTM and GPT, demonstrating the capabilities of GPT in producing semantically close text.
