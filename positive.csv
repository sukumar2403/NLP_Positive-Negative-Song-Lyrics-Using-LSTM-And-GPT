 this particular diamond was extra special 
 and though you might be gone and the world may not know

 like a lion you ran a goddess you rolled 
 like an eagle you circled in perfect purple 
 so how come things move on how come cars don't slow 
 when it feels like the end of my world 
 when i should but i can't let you go 
  
  
 but when i'm cold cold 
 yeah when i'm cold cold 
 there's a light that you give me when i'm in shadow 
 there's a feelin' within me everglow 
  
   
 like brothers in blood sisters who ride 
 and we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die 
 but the changin' of winds and the way waters flow 
 life is short as the fallin' of snow 
 and now i'm gonna miss you i know

 in water rolled salt 
 and i know that you're with me and the way you will show 
 and you're with me wherever i go 
 and you give me this feelin' this everglow 
  
  
 oh what i wouldn't give for just a moment to hold

 would you panic and hide

 theres nothin' goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on 
 you got to trust me ma 
  
   
 i can't believe i believed everything we had would last 
 so young and naive of me to think she was from your past 
 silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids 
 love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong 
 i can't believe i fell for your schemes i'm smarter than that 
 so dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man 
 foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women 
 it took me some time but now i moved on 
 because i realized i've got 
  
  
 me myself and i 
 that's all i got in the end that's what i found out 
 and it ain't no need to cry 
 i took a vow that from now on i'm gon' be my own best friend

 and it ain't no need to cry 
 i took a vow that from now on i'm gon' be my own best friend

 next thing i know i'm dealing with your three kids in my home 
 love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong 
 now that it's over stop callin' me come pick up your clothes 
 ain't no need to front like you're still with me all your homies know 
 even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low 
 took me some time but now i am strong 
 because i realized i've got 
  
  
 me myself and i 
 that's all i got in the end that's what i found out

 yeah i was born a misfit 
 grew up miles from the town of ipswich 
 wanted to make it big i wished it to existence 
 i never was a sick kid always dismissed quick 
 stick to singing stop rappin' like it's christmas 
 and if you're talkin' money then my conversation's shiftin' 
 my dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list 
 might be insanity but people call it gifted 
 my face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with 
 watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted 
 my wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick 
 i'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business 
 and if i had my minutes i must have missed 'em 
  years old is when i came in the game 
 and now it's eight years on and you remember the name 
 and if you thought i was good well then i'm better today 
 but it's ironic how you people thought i'd never be great

 i was born inside a small town i lost that state of mind 
 learned to sing inside the lord's house but stopped the age of nine 
 i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride 
 the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind 
 so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
 friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
 and when the world's against me is when i really come alive 
 and every day that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride 
 you know that i've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs 
 i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun 
 i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up 
 instead i look in the mirror questionin' what i've become 
 guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
 without a ninetofive job or a uni degree 
 to be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
 show me the locked doors i'll find another use for the key 
 and you'll see

 i'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me 
 but with that said give me one more ahyeah

 i used to think that nothin' could be better than touring the world with my songs 
 i chased the pictured perfect life i think they painted it wrong 
 i think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell 
 relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well 
 and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
 because you're livin' your dream man this  should be fun 
 please know that i'm not tryna preach like i'm reverend run 
 i beg you don't be disappointed with the man i've become 
 have conversations with my father on the a 
 age twelve tellin' me i've gotta chase those dreams 
 now i'm playing for the people dad and they know me 
 with my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans 
 wembley stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou' 
 i may have grown up but i hope that damian's proud 
 and to the next generation inspiration's allowed 
 the world may be filled with hate but keep erasin' it now 
 somehow

 i heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans

 wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet

 my flows developing skin lacks the melanin 
 give me a shot of adrenaline and i get it in 
 do it for the hell of it 
 cause ever since i hit the mainstream with the a team i seem to sell a bit 
 i took what held me back with the women then i packaged the image 
 put in some content then i sold it back as a gimmick 
 the fact is this i'll end up dating actresses 
 wake up on dirty mattresses i think i'll need to practice this 
 but i make shit happen call me a laxative

 oh i'm here again 
 between the devil and the danger but i guess it's just my nature 
 my dad was wrong 'cause i'm not like my mum 
 'cause she'd just smile and i'm complaining in a song 
 but it helps 
 so before i save someone else i've got to save myself 
  
  
 life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels 
 i drown it with a drink and outofdate prescription pills 
 and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf 
 no farewell 
 so before i save someone else i've got to save myself 
  
  
 and before i blame someone else i've got to save myself 
 and before i love someone else i've got to love myselfembed",1

 love you through whatever who you tryna skip a meal for 
 girl you're too precious why you tryna split the bill for 
 i ain't even gassing they should have you up on billboards that's real talk 
 and you can go to work and let me pick up the slack 
 and when you finished what you're doing we'll be kicking it back 
 we can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps 
 and i got money in the bank but not a figure like that 
 you got me looking at your shape man i've already won

 and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit 
 they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot 
 but then again that's what they're supposed to do 
 and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
 whisperin' everything that happens is from now on 
 i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song 
 and still they're claiming that i handled it wrong 
 but then i've never had an enemy except the nme 
 but i'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be 
 with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
 are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree 
 singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids 
 i keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic 
 i'm battlin' for respect and i don't know if i have it 
 this song's from the heart cover the planet 
 i'll take it back now 
  
  
 mmm come on and take it back love 
 come on and take it back for us 
 don't you fade into the back love no 
 i'll take it back now 
   
 now i don't ever wanna be perfect 
 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless 
 and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worstdressed 
 taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus 
 puttin' on a brave face like timothy dalton 
 considerin' a name change thinkin' it was hopeless 
 rhymin' over recordings avoidin' tradition 
 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody can be written 
 now absence can make your heart ache 
 but drinking absinthe can change your mind state 
 vividly need to let my liver be 
 and i say it again livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends 
 it's good advice from a man who took his life on the road with me 
 and i hope to see him blowin' up globally 
 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screamin' out vocally 
 it might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams but 
 but i just write schemes i'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans 
 madison square garden is where i might be but more likely 
 you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates 
 havin' a pint with mcdaid discussin' records we made 
 and every single second knowin' that we'll never betray 
 the way we were raised rememberin' our background sat down 
 that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now 
  
  
 mmm come on and take it back love 
 come on and take it back for us 
 don't you fade into the back love no 
 mmm come on and take it back love 
 come on and take it back for us 
 don't you fade into the back love no mmmembed",1

Ed-sheeran,"contributorstranslationsfrançaisnina lyrics  
 i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well 
 and i could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell 
 sometimes i wonder in any other summer 
 could you have been my parttime lover to me listenin' to stevie wonder 
 under the covers where we used to lay 
 and re stacks is what the speakers played 
 i'd be on tour almost every day 
 when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay 
 just watchin' a dvd smokin' illegal weed 
 gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe 
 we used each other's air just for the people to see 
 and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
 we'd go anywhere our minds would take us 
 and i'd say you are beautiful without your makeup 
 and you don't even need to worry 'bout your weight 
 'cause we can all be loved the way that god made us 
 and time's the only reason that we could break up 
 'cause you would always tell me i'm away too much 
 distance is relative to the time that it takes 
 to get on a plane or make a mistake so say it again 
  
  
 oh nina 
 you should go nina 
 'cause i ain't ever comin' home nina 
 oh won't you leave me now

 'cause that's you and me both nina 
 oh won't you leave me now now 
 see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as you might also like  
 and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie 
 with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold 
 taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 
 'cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone 
 watchin' blue planet creatin' new habits 
 actin' as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish 
 back to the burrow with all the celtics 
 i'd disappear you'd call me selfish 
 i understand but i can't help it 
 i put my job over everything except my family and friends 
 but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back 
 overlook the situation 
 'cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications 
 and i'm not saying we should be takin' a break 
 just reevaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late 
 so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane 
 but in a day we'll have to say it again

 the city far behind

 to pray to him by candlelight 
  
 then peering through the glass 
 i saw with disbelief 
 still dressed in royal clothes 
 the saint behind the altar 
  
 history recalls 
 during times of war 
 legend has been traced 
 back inside these castle walls 
  
 where soldiers came to hide 
 in barrels filled with wine 
 never to escape 
 these tombs of oak are where they died

 down the cellar stairs 
 i disappear

 did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
 to last through forever and another day 
 just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
 and the seasons know exactly when to change 
 just as kindness knows no shame 
 know through all your joy and pain 
 that i'll be loving you always 
 as today i know i'm living but tomorrow 
 could make me the past but that i mustn't fear 
 for i'll know deep in my mind 
 the love of me i've left behind 
 'cause i'll be loving you always

 until the day is night and night becomes the day always 
 until the trees and seas just up and fly away always 
 until the day that eight times eight times eight is four always 
 until the day that is the day that are no more did you know you're loved by somebody 
 until the day the earth starts turning right to left always 
 until the earth just for the sun denies itself i'll be loving you forever 
 until dear mother nature says her work is through always 
 until the day that you are me and i am you always 
 until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky always 
 until the ocean covers every mountain high always 
  
  
 we all know sometimes life's hates and troubles 
 can make you wish you were born in another time and space 
 but you can bet your life times that and twice its double 
 that god knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed 
 so make sure when you say you're in it but not of it 
 you're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called hell 
 change your words into truth and then change that truth into love 
 and maybe our children's grandchildren 
 and their greatgrandchildren will tell 
 i'll be loving you 
  
 refrain 
 until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky loving you 
 until the ocean covers every mountain high loving you 
 until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea loving you 
 until we dream of life and life becomes a dream be loving you 
 until the day is night and night becomes the day loving you 
 until the trees and seas just up and fly away loving you

 looking back on when i was a little nappyheaded boy 
 then my only worry was for christmas what would be my toy 
 even though we sometimes would not get a thing 
 we were happy with the joy the day would bring 
 sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine 
 greeted at the back door with boy thought i told you not to go outside 
 tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes 
 thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

 why did those days ever have to go 
 i wish those days could come back once more 
 why did those days ever have to go

 people hand in hand 
 have i lived to see the milk and honey land 
 where hate's a dream and love forever stands 
 or is this a vision in my mind 
  
   
 the law was never passed 
 but somehow all men feel they are truly free at last 
 have we really gone this far through space and time 
 or is this a vision in my mind

 i know that leaves are green 
 they only turn to brown when autumn comes around 
 i know just what i say 
 today's not yesterday 
 and all things have an ending

 is could a place like this exist so beautiful

 how many of you people out there 
 been hurt in some kind of love affair 
 and how many times do you swear that you'll never love again 
 how many lonely sleepless nights 
 how many lies how many fights 
 and why would you want to put yourself through all that again 
 love is pain i hear you say 
 love has a cruel and bitter way 
 of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain 
 how could it be that what you need the most 
 can leave you feeling just like a ghost 
 you never want to feel so sad and lost again 
 one day you could be looking 
 through an old book in rainy weather 
 you see a picture of her smiling at you 
 when you were still together 
 you could be walking down the street 
 and who should you chance to meet 
 but that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

 i looked out across the river today 
 saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play 
 saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light 
 two priests on the ferry 
 october geese on a cold winter's night 
  
  
 all this time the river flowed 
 endlessly to the sea 
   
 two priests came 'round our house tonight 
 one young one old to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite 
 one to learn one to teach which way the cold wind blows 
 and fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows 
  
  
 all this time the river flowed 
 endlessly to the sea 
 if i had my way 
 i'd take a boat from the river 
 and i'd bury the old man 
 i'd bury him at sea 
  
   
 blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the earth 
 better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle 
 as these words were spoken i swear i hear the old man laughing

 they built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town 
 they lived and they died 
 they prayed to their gods but the stone gods did not make a sound 
 and their empire crumbles 'till all that was left 
 were the stones the workmen found

 when she finds the tomb empty the stone had been rolled

 when she reaches the door sees an unholy sight 
 there's this solitary figure in a halo of light

 in an almighty hurry aye but she might catch him still

 now don't hinder me woman i've no time to waste 
 for they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon 
 and i have to be there before daybreak

Sting,"contributorsmy funny friend and me lyrics  
 in the quiet time of evening 
 when the stars assume their patterns 
 and the day has made his journey 
 and we wondered just what happened 
 to the life we knew before the world changed 
 when not a thing i held was true 
 but you were kind to me and you reminded me 
 that the world is not my playground 
 there are other things that matter 
 and when a simple needs protecting 
 my illusions all would shatter 
 but you stayed in my corner 
 the only world i know was upside down 
 and now the world and me i know you carry me 
  
  
 you see the patterns in the big sky 
 those constellations look like you and i 
 just like the patterns in the big sky 
 we could be lost we could refuse to try 
 but we made it through in the dark night 
 would those lucky guys turn out to be 
 but that unusual blend of my funny friend and me 
  
   
 i'm not as clever as i thought i was 
 i'm not the boy i used to be because 
 you showed me something different you showed me something pure 
 i always seemed so certain but i was really never sure 
 but you stayed and you called my name 
 when others would have walked out on a lousy game 
 and you could've made it through 
 but your funny friend and me

 don't know the answer or the reason why

 the geese are flying south it sets me thinking 
 i did not miss you much i did not suffer 
 what did not kill me just made me tougher 
  
 i feel the winter come his icy sinews 
 now in the firelight the case continues 
 another night in court the same old trial 
 the same old questions asked the same denial 
  
 the shadows close me round like jury members 
 i look for answers in the fire's embers 
 why was i missing then that whole december 
 i give my usual line i don't remember 
  
 another winter comes his icy fingers creep 
 into these bones of mine these memories never sleep 
 and all these differences a cloak i borrow 
 we kept our distances why should it follow 
 that i must have loved you

 i wore this mask to hide my scars

Sting,"contributorsi love her but she loves someone else lyrics  
 when a man of my age shaves his face in the morning 
 who is it that stares back and greets him 
 the ghost of his father long dead all these years 
 or the boy that he was still wet in the ears 
 or the terrible sum of all of his fears 
 in the eyes of this stranger who meets him 
 so his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline 
 to face up to the truth of his soul 
 it's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge 
 something strange unexpected out of control 
 there are times when a man needs to brave his reflection 
 and face what he sees without fear 
 it takes a man to accept his mortality 
 or be surprised by the presence of a tear 
 it was only an arrangement a practical arrangement 
 i forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook 
 don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself 
 and fall in love with someone when she loves someone else 
  
  
 like a covering of snow on a winter's night 
 it glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight 
 but it's gone by the morning how quickly it melts 
 you still love her but she loves someone else

 and where does that leave you 
 you selfstyled man of vision 
 you feel stupid you feel angry are you losing your mind 
 to destroy the one she loves does that become your mission

 to regain your selfrespect hold your head up like a man 
 use the ice around your heart before it melts 
 but you're not fooling anybody you're only fooling yourself

 it glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight 
 but it's gone by the morning how quickly it melts

 'til we were dead and gone and buried 
 check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same 
 after three months in the grave 
 and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you 
 but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame 
 see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as you might also likepre 
 and i know it's long gone and 
 there was nothing else i could do 
 and i forget about you long enough 
 to forget why i needed to 
  
  
 'cause there we are again in the middle of the night 
 we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light 
 down the stairs i was there 
 i remember it all too well 
 and there we are again when nobody had to know 
 you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath 
 sacred prayer and we'd swear 
 to remember it all too well yeah 
  
  
 well maybe we got lost in translation 
 maybe i asked for too much 
 but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 
 'til you tore it all up 
 running scared i was there 
 i remember it all too well 
 and you call me up again just to break me like a promise 
 so casually cruel in the name of being honest 
 i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 
 'cause i remember it all all all 
   
 they say all's well that ends well but i'm in a new hell 
 every time you doublecross my mind 
 you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine 
 and that made me want to die 
 the idea you had of me who was she 
 a neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you 
 not weeping in a party bathroom 
 some actress asking me what happened you 
 that's what happened you 
 you who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes 
 sipping coffee like you're on a latenight show 
 but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come 
 and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twentyone 
  
   
 time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it 
 i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it 
 after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own 
 now you mail back my things and i walk home alone 
 but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 
 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me 
 you can't get rid of it 
 'cause you remember it all too well yeah 
  
  
 'cause there we are again when i loved you so 
 back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known 
 it was rare i was there 
 i remember it all too well 
 wind in my hair you were there 
 you remember it all 
 down the stairs you were there 
 you remember it all 
 it was rare i was there 
 i remember it all too well 
   
 and i was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes 
 i'll get older but your lovers stay my age 
 from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones 
 i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight 
 and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue 
 just between us did the love affair maim you too 
 'cause in this city's barren cold 
 i still remember the first fall of snow 
 and how it glistened as it fell 
 i remember it all too well 
  
  
 just between us did the love affair maim you all too well 
 just between us do you remember it all too well 
 just between us i remember it just between us all too well 
 wind in my hair i was there i was there 
 down the stairs i was there i was there 
 sacred prayer i was there i was there 
 it was rare you remember it all too well 
 wind in my hair i was there i was there 
 down the stairs i was there i was there 
 sacred prayer i was there i was there 
 it was rare you remember it 
 wind in my hair i was there i was there 
 down the stairs i was there i was there 
 sacred prayer i was there i was there 
 it was rare you remember it 
 wind in my hair i was there i was there 
 down the stairs i was there i was there

 was what i did to you

 would you have me would you want me 
 would you tell me to go fuck myself

 i'm only seventeen i don't know anything

 from the far side of the gym

 see you make your way through the crowd

 and my daddy said stay away from juliet 
 and i was crying on the staircase 
 begging you please don't go and i said

 i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run 
 you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess

 wondering if you were ever coming around

 when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said 
  
  
 romeo save me i've been feeling so alone 
 i keep waiting for you but you never come 
 is this in my head i don't know what to think 
 he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said 
 marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone 
 i love you and that's all i really know

 gave me the blues and then purplepink skies

 fresh dirt under my fingernails and 
 i can smell hot asphalt 
 cars screech to a halt to let me pass

 what life was like through photographs 
 and trying to recreate 
 images life gives us from our past 
 and sometimes it's a sad song 
  
  
 but i cannot forget refuse to regret 
 so glad i met you and 
 take my breath away make every day 
 worth all of the pain that i've gone through

 and we're only several miles from the sun

 ended up on a crossroad 
 tried to figure out which way to go 
 it's like you're stuck on a treadmill 
 running in the same place 
 you got your hazard lights on now 
 hoping that somebody would slow down 
 praying for a miracle 
 ooh show your grace 
 had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas 
 with a long journey ahead 
 seen a truck pull over 
 god sent an angel to help you out 
 he gave you direction 
 showed you how to read a map 
 for the long journey ahead 
 said it ain't over 
 oh even in the midst of doubt 
  
  
 life is worth living 
 life is worth living so live another day 
 the meaning of forgiveness 
 people make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in 
 life is worth living again

 avalanche comin' down slow 
 do we have enough time to salvage this love 
 feels like a blizzard in april 
 cause my heart it's just that cold 
 skating on thin ice 
 but it's strong enough to hold us up 
 seen her scream and holler 
 put us both on blast 
 tearing each other down 
 when i thought it was over 
 god sent in an angel to help us out 
 he gave us direction showed us how to make it last 
 for that long journey ahead 
 said it ain't ever over

 what i get from my reflection 
 is a difference in perception 
 from what the world may see 
 they tried to crucify me 
 i ain't perfect won't deny 
 my reputation's on the line 
 so i'm working on a better me

 eyes deeper than the ocean 
 love me hard like where you been 
 love me like you don't want it to end

 thank you yes you're less than five minutes away from me 
 in your arms rubbing on your face 
 only place i wanna be 
 in the bed where we lay our head 
 only place i wanna beembed",1
